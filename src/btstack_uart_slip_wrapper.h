 * Compatibility layer to use new H5 implementation with btstack_uart.h implementations without SLIP support.
 * Using this compatibility layer caused increased processing as it uses single byte UART reads.
 *
 * If you're using H5, please consider implement the H5/SLIP functions in your btstack_uart.h or hal_uart_dma.h implementation.
