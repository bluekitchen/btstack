 *
 * To use with your application, add `#import <battery_service.gatt>` to your .gatt file.
 * After adding it to your .gatt file, you call *battery_service_server_init(value)* with the
 * current value of your battery. The valid range for the battery level is 0-100.
 *
 * If the battery level changes, you can call *battery_service_server_set_battery_value(value)*.
 * The service supports sending Notifications if the client enables them.
