## L2CAP Events {#sec:eventsAndErrorsAppendix}

L2CAP events and data packets are delivered to the packet handler
specified by *l2cap_register_service* resp.
*l2cap_create_channel*. Data packets have the
L2CAP_DATA_PACKET packet type. L2CAP provides the following events:

-   L2CAP_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED - sent if channel establishment is
    done. Status not equal zero indicates an error. Possible errors: out
    of memory; connection terminated by local host, when the connection
    to remote device fails.

-   L2CAP_EVENT_CHANNEL_CLOSED - emitted when channel is closed. No
    status information is provided.

-   L2CAP_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION - received when the connection is
    requested by remote. Connection accept and decline are performed
    with *l2cap_accept_connection* and *l2cap_decline_connecti-on* respectively.

-   L2CAP_EVENT_CAN_SEND_NOW - Indicates that an L2CAP data packet could
    be sent on the reported l2cap_cid. It is emitted after a call to
    *l2cap_request_can_send_now*. See [Sending L2CAP Data](protocols/#sec:l2capSendProtocols)
    Please note that the guarantee that a packet can be sent is only valid when the event is received.
    After returning from the packet handler, BTstack might need to send itself.

## RFCOMM Events

All RFCOMM events and data packets are currently delivered to the packet
handler specified by *rfcomm_register_packet_handler*. Data packets
have the _DATA_PACKET packet type. Here is the list of events provided
by RFCOMM:

-   RFCOMM_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION - received when the connection
    is requested by remote. Connection accept and decline are performed
    with *rfcomm_accept_connection* and
    *rfcomm_decline_connection* respectively.

-   RFCOMM_EVENT_CHANNEL_CLOSED - emitted when channel is closed. No
    status information is provided.

-   RFCOMM_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED - sent if channel
    establishment is done. Status not equal zero indicates an error.
    Possible errors: an L2CAP error, out of memory.

-   RFCOMM_EVENT_CAN_SEND_NOW - Indicates that an RFCOMM data packet could
    be sent on the reported rfcomm_cid. It is emitted after a call to
    *rfcomm_request_can_send_now*. See [Sending RFCOMM Data](protocols/#sec:rfcommSendProtocols)
    Please note that the guarantee that a packet can be sent is only valid when the event is received.
    After returning from the packet handler, BTstack might need to send itself.
