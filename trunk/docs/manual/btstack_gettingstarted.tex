% \section{Overview}

Thanks for checking out BTstack! In this manual, we first provide the usual 'quick starter guide' before highlighting BTstack's main design choices and going into more details with a few examples. Finally, we outline the basic steps when integrating BTstack into existing single-threaded or even multi-threaded environments. The Revision History is shown in the Appendix \ref{appendix:revision_history} on page \pageref{appendix:revision_history}.

\section{Quick Start}


\section{BTstack Architecture}

As well as any other communication stack, BTstack is a collection of state machines that interact with each other. There is one or more state machines for each protocol and service that it implements. The rest of the architecture follows these fundamental design guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Single threaded design} - BTstack does not use or require multi-threading to handle data sources and timers. Instead, it uses a single run loop.
\item \emph{No blocking anywhere} - If Bluetooth processing is required, its result will be delivered as an event via registered packet handlers.
\item \emph{No artificially limited buffers/pools} - Incoming and outgoing data packets are not queued.
\item \emph{Statically bounded memory (optionally)} - The number of maximum connections/channels/services can be configured.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

   \caption{BTstack-based single-threaded application. The Main Application contains the application logic, e.g., reading a sensor value and providing it via the Communication Logic as a SPP Server.
    The Communication Logic is often modeled as a finite state machine with events and data coming from either the Main Application or from BTstack via registered  packet handlers (PH).   
    BTstack's Run Loop is responsible for providing timers and processing incoming data.
}
    
   \label{fig:BTstackArchitecture}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:BTstackArchitecture} shows the general architecture of a BTstack-based application that includes the BTstack run loop.

\subsection{Single threaded design}
BTstack does not use or require multi-threading. It uses a single run loop to handle data sources and timers. Data sources represent communication interfaces like an UART or an USB driver. 
Timers are used by BTstack to implement various Bluetooth-related timeouts. For example, to disconnect a Bluetooth baseband channel without an active L2CAP channel after 20 seconds. They can also be used to handle periodic events. During a run loop cycle, the callback functions of all registered data sources are called. Then, the callback functions of timers that are ready are executed. 

For adapting BTstack to multi-threaded environments, see Section \ref{section:multithreading}.


\subsection{No blocking anywhere}

Bluetooth logic is event-driven. Therefore, all BTstack functions are non-blocking, i.e., all functions that cannot return immediately implement an asynchronous pattern. If the arguments of a function are valid, the necessary commands are sent to the Bluetooth chipset and the function returns with a success  value. The actual result is delivered later as an asynchronous event via registered packet handlers. 

If a Bluetooth event triggers longer processing by the application, the processing should be split into smaller chunks. The packet handler could then schedule a timer that manages the sequential execution of the chunks.

\subsection{No artificially limited buffers/pools}
Incoming and outgoing data packets are not queued. BTstack delivers an incoming data packet to the application before it receives the next one from the Bluetooth chipset. Therefore, it relies on the link layer of the Bluetooth chipset to slow down the remote sender when needed. 

Similarly, the application has to adapt its packet generation to the remote receiver for outgoing data. 
L2CAP relies on ACL flow control between sender and receiver. If there are no free ACL buffers in the Bluetooth module, the application cannot send.  For RFCOMM, the mandatory credit-based flow-control limits the data sending rate additionally. The application can only send an RFCOMM packet if it has RFCOMM credits.

\subsection{Statically bounded memory}
BTstack has to keep track of services and active connections on the various protocol layers. The number of maximum connections/channels/services can be configured. In addition, the non-persistent database for remote device names and link keys needs memory and can be be configured, too. These numbers determine the amount of static memory allocation.


\section{How to use BTstack}
BTstack implements a set of basic Bluetooth protocols. To make use of these to connect to other devices or to provide own services, BTstack has to be properly configured during application startup. 

In the following, we provide an overview of the memory management, the run loop, and services that are necessary to setup BTstack. From the point when the run loop is executed, the application runs as a finite state machine, which processes events received from BTstack. BTstack groups events logically and provides them over packet handlers, of which an overview is provided here. Finally, we describe the RFCOMM credit-based flow-control, which may be necessary for resource-constraint devices. Complete examples for the MSP430 platforms will be presented in Chapter \ref{examples}. 

\subsection{Memory configuration}
\label{section:memory_configuration}

The structs for services, active connections and remote devices can be allocated in two different manners: 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item statically from an individual memory pool, whose maximal number of elements  is defined in the config file. To initialize the static pools, you need to call \emph{btstack\_memory\_init} function. An example of memory configuration for a single SPP service with a minimal L2CAP MTU is shown in Listing \ref{memoryConfigurationSPP}.
        \item dynamically using the \emph{malloc/free} functions, if HAVE\_MALLOC is defined in config file. 
        \end{itemize}

If both HAVE\_MALLOC and  maximal size of a pool are defined in the config file, the statical allocation will take precedence. In case that both are omitted, an error will be raised.

The memory is set up by calling \emph{btstack\_memory\_init} function:
\begin{lstlisting}
btstack_memory_init();
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Run loop}
\label{section:run_loop}

BTstack uses a run loop to handle incoming data and to schedule work. The run loop handles events from two different types of sources: data sources and timers. Data sources represent communication interfaces like an UART or an USB driver. Timers are used by BTstack to implement various Bluetooth-related timeouts. They can also be used to handle periodic events. 

Data sources and timers are represented by the  structs \emph{data\_source\_t} and \emph{timer\_source\_t} respectively. Each of these structs contain a link list node and a pointer to a callback function. All active timers and data sources are kept in link lists. While the list of data sources is unsorted, the timers are sorted by expiration timeout for efficient processing.

The complete run loop cycle looks like this: first, the callback function of all registered data sources are called in a round robin way. Then, the callback functions of timers that are ready are executed. Finally, it will be checked if another run loop iteration has been requested by an interrupt handler. If not, the run loop will put the MCU into sleep mode.

Incoming data over the UART, USB, or timer ticks will generate an interrupt and wake up the microcontroller. In order to avoid the situation where a data source becomes ready just before the run loop enters sleep mode, an interrupt-driven data source has to call the \emph{embedded\_trigger} function. The call to \emph{embedded\_trigger} sets an internal flag that is checked in the critical section just before entering sleep mode. 

Timers are single shot: a timer will be removed from the timer list before its event handler callback is executed. If you need a periodic timer, you can re-register the same timer source in the callback function, see Section \ref{section:periodicTimer} for an example. Note that BTstack expects to get called periodically to keep its time, see Section \ref{section:tickAbstraction} for more on the tick hardware abstraction. 

The Run loop API is provided in Appendix \ref{appendix:api_run_loop}. To enable the use of timers, make sure that you defined HAVE\_TICK in the config file.

In your code, you'll have to configure the run loop before you start it as shown in Listing \ref{RunLoopExecution}. The application can register data sources as well as timers, e.g., periodical sampling of sensors, or communication over the UART.

The run loop is set up by calling \emph{run\_loop\_init} function for embedded systems:
\begin{lstlisting}
run_loop_init(RUN_LOOP_EMBEDDED);
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{BTstack initialization}
\label{section:btstack_initialization}
To initialize BTstack you need to initialize the memory and the run loop as explained in Sections \ref{section:memory_configuration} and \ref{section:run_loop} respectively, then setup HCI and all needed higher level protocols.

The HCI initialization has to adapt BTstack to the used platform and requires four arguments. These are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Bluetooth hardware control}: The Bluetooth hardware control API can provide the HCI layer with a custom initialization script, a vendor-specific baud rate change command, and system power notifications. It is also used to control the power mode of the Bluetooth module, i.e., turning it on/off and putting to sleep. In addition, it provides an error handler \emph{hw\_error} that is called when a Hardware Error is reported by the Bluetooth module. The callback allows for persistent logging or signaling of this failure. 

Overall, the struct \emph{bt\_control\_t} encapsulates common functionality that is not covered by the Bluetooth specification. As an example, the \emph{bt\_con-trol\_cc256x\_in-stance} function returns a pointer to a control struct suitable for the CC256x chipset.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
bt_control_t * control = bt_control_cc256x_instance();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{HCI Transport implementation}: On embedded systems, a Bluetooth module can be connected via USB or an UART port. BTstack implements two UART based protocols: HCI UART Transport Layer (H4) and H4 with eHCILL support, a lightweight low-power variant by Texas Instruments.
These are accessed by linking the appropriate file (\path{src/hci_transport_h4_dma.c} resp. \path{src/hci_transport_h4_ehcill_dma.c)} and then getting a pointer to HCI Transport implementation. For more information on adapting HCI Transport to different environments, see Section \ref{section:hci_transport}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
hci_transport_t * transport = hci_transport_h4_dma_instance();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph {HCI Transport configuration}: As the configuration of the UART used in the H4 transport interface are not standardized, it has to be provided by the main application to BTstack. In addition to the initial UART baud rate, the main baud rate can be specified. The HCI layer of BTstack will change the init baud rate to the main one after the basic setup of the Bluetooth module. A baud rate change has to be done in a coordinated way at both HCI and hardware level. First, the HCI command to change the baud rate is sent, then it is necessary to wait for the confirmation event from the Bluetooth module. Only now, can the UART baud rate changed. As an example, the CC256x has to be initialized at 115200 and can then be used at higher speeds.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
hci_uart_config_t* config = hci_uart_config_cc256x_instance();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph {Persistent storage} - specifies where to persist data like link keys or remote device names. This commonly requires platform specific code to access the MCU's EEPROM of Flash storage. For the first steps, BTstack provides a (non) persistent store in memory. For more see Section \ref{section:persistent_storage}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
remote_device_db_t * remote_db = &remote_device_db_memory;
\end{lstlisting}


After these are ready, HCI is initialized like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
hci_init(transport, config, control, remote_db);
\end{lstlisting}

The higher layers only rely on BTstack and are initialized by calling the respective \emph{*\_init} function. These init functions register themselves with the underlying layer. In addition, the application can register packet handlers to get events and data as explained in the following section.


\subsection{Services}
One important construct of BTstack is \emph{service}. A service represents a server side component that handles incoming connections. So far, BTstack provides L2CAP and RFCOMM services. An L2CAP service handles incoming connections for an L2CAP channel and is registered with its protocol service multiplexer ID (PSM). Similarly,  an RFCOMM service handles incoming RFCOMM connections and is registered with the RFCOMM channel ID. Outgoing connections require no special registration, they are created by the application when needed.

\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Where to get data - packet handlers}
\label{section:packetHandlers}

After the hardware and BTstack are set up, the run loop is entered. From now on everything is event driven. The application calls BTstack functions, which in turn may send commands to the Bluetooth module. The resulting events are delivered back to the application. Instead of writing a single callback handler for each possible event (as it is done in some other Bluetooth stacks), BTstack groups events logically and provides them over a single generic interface.  Appendix \ref{appendix:api_events_and_errors} summarizes the parameters and event codes of L2CAP and RFCOMM events, as well as possible errors and the corresponding error codes.

Here is summarized list of packet handlers that an application might use:
\begin{itemize}
\item HCI packet handler - handles HCI and general BTstack events if L2CAP is not used (rare case). 
\item L2CAP packet handler - handles HCI and general BTstack events.
\item L2CAP service packet handler - handles incoming L2CAP connections, i.e., channels initiated by the remote.
\item L2CAP channel packet handler - handles outgoing L2CAP connections,  i.e., channels initiated internally.
\item RFCOMM packet handler - handles RFCOMM  incoming/outgoing events and data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table*}\centering
\caption{Functions for registering packet handlers}
\begin{tabular}{rl}\toprule
Packet Handler & Registering Function\\ 
\midrule
HCI packet handler &  \emph{hci\_register\_packet\_handler}\\
L2CAP packet handler &  \emph{l2cap\_register\_packet\_handler}\\
L2CAP service packet handler & \emph{l2cap\_register\_service\_internal}\\
L2CAP channel packet handler & \emph{l2cap\_create\_channel\_internal}\\
RFCOMM packet handler & \emph{rfcomm\_register\_packet\_handler}\\
\bottomrule
 \label{table:registeringFunction}
 \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

These handlers are registered with the functions listed in Table \ref{table:registeringFunction}. 

HCI and general BTstack events are delivered to the packet handler specified by \emph{l2cap\_register\_packet\_handler} function, or \emph{hci\_register\_packet\_handler}, if L2CAP is not used. In L2CAP, BTstack discriminates incoming and outgoing connections, i.e., event and data packets are delivered to different packet handlers. Outgoing connections are used access remote services, incoming connections are used to provide services. For incoming connections, the packet handler specified by \emph{l2cap\_register\_service} is used. For outgoing connections, the handler provided by \emph{l2cap\_create\_channel\_internal} is used.
Currently, RFCOMM provides only a single packet handler specified by \emph{rfcomm\_register\_packet\_handler} for all RFCOMM connections, but this will be fixed in the next API overhaul.
 
The application can register a single shared packet handler for all protocols and services, or use separate packet handlers for each protocol layer and service. A shared packet handler is often used for stack initialization and connection management.

Separate packet handlers can be used for each L2CAP service and outgoing connection. For example, to connect with a Bluetooth HID keyboard, your application could use three packet handlers: one to handle HCI events during discovery of a keyboard registered by \emph{l2cap\_register\_packet\_handler}; one that will be registered to an outgoing L2CAP channel to connect to keyboard and to receive keyboard data registered by \emph{l2cap\_create\_channel\_internal}; after that keyboard can reconnect by itself. For this, you need to register L2CAP services for the HID Control and HID Interrupt PSMs using \emph{l2cap\_register\_service\_internal}. In this call, you'll also specify a packet handler to accept and receive keyboard data.

\section{Quick Recipes}

\subsection{Periodic time handler}
\label{section:periodicTimer}
As timers in BTstack are single shot, a periodic timer, e.g., to implement a counter or to periodically sample a sesor,  is implemented by re-registering the \emph{timer\_source} in the \emph{timer\_handler} callback function, as shown in  Listing \ref{PeriodicTimeHandler}.

\subsection{Defining custom HCI command templates}

Each HCI command is assigned a 2 byte OpCode used to uniquely identify different types of commands. The OpCode parameter is divided into two fields, called the OpCode Group Field (OGF) and OpCode Command Field (OCF), see \BluetoothSpecification{} - Core Version 4.0, Volume 2, Part E, Chapter 5.4. In a HCI command, the OpCode is followed by parameter total length, and the actual parameters.

BTstack provides the \emph{hci\_cmd\_t} struct as a compact format to define HCI command packets, see Listing \ref{HCIcmdTemplate},  and \path{include/btstack/hci_cmds.h} file in the source code. The OpCode of a command can be calculated using the OPCODE macro. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Periodic counter, label=PeriodicTimeHandler]
#define TIMER_PERIOD_MS 1000
timer_source_t periodic_timer;

void register_timer(timer_source_t *timer, uint16_t period){
    run_loop_set_timer(timer, period);
    run_loop_add_timer(timer);
}

void timer_handler(timer_source_t *ts){
    // do something,
    ... e.g., increase counter,
    
    // then re-register timer
    register_timer(ts, TIMER_PERIOD_MS);
} 

void timer_setup(){
    // set one-shot timer
    run_loop_set_timer_handler(&periodic_timer, &timer_handler);
    register_timer(&periodic_timer, TIMER_PERIOD_MS);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = hci\_cmds.h defines HCI command template., label=HCIcmdTemplate]
// Calculate combined ogf/ocf value.
#define OPCODE(ogf, ocf) (ocf | ogf << 10)

// Compact HCI Command packet description.
typedef struct {
    uint16_t    opcode;
    const char *format;
} hci_cmd_t;

extern const hci_cmd_t hci_write_local_name;
...
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=hci.h defines possible OGFs used for creation of a HCI command., label=hciCmdOGF]
#define OGF_LINK_CONTROL  0x01

#define OGF_LE_CONTROLLER   0x08
#define OGF_BTSTACK  0x3d
#define OGF_VENDOR  0x3f
\end{lstlisting}

Listing \ref{hciCmdOGF} shows the OGFs provided by BTstack in \path{src/hci.h} file.  For all existing Bluetooth commands and their OCFs see \BluetoothSpecificationURL{} - Core Version 4.0, Volume 2, Part E, Chapter 7.

Listing \ref{HCIcmdExample} illustrates the \emph{hci\_write\_local\_name} HCI command template from \mbox{BTstack} library. It uses  OGF\_CONTROLLER\_BASEBAND as OGF, 0x13 as OCF, and has one parameter with format "N" indicating a null terminated UTF-8 string. Table \ref{table:hciformat} lists the format specifiers supported by BTstack. Check \path{src/hci_cmds.c} for other predefined HCI commands and info on their parameters.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= Example of HCI command template., label=HCIcmdExample]
// Sets local Bluetooth name
const hci_cmd_t hci_write_local_name = {
    OPCODE(OGF_CONTROLLER_BASEBAND, 0x13), "N"
    // Local name (UTF-8, Null Terminated, max 248 octets)
};
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{table*}\centering

\begin{tabular}{cl}\toprule

\midrule

"S" & Service Record (Data Element Sequence)\\
\bottomrule
\label{table:hciformat}
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Sending  HCI command based on a template}
You can use the \emph{hci\_send-\_cmd} function to send HCI command based on a template and a list of parameters. However, it is necessary to check that the outgoing packet buffer is empty and that the Bluetooth module is ready to receive the next command - most modern Bluetooth modules only allow  to send a single HCI command. This can be done by calling \emph{hci\_can\_send\_packet\_now(HCI\_COMMAND\_DATA\_PACKET)} function, which returns true, if it is ok to send. Note: we'll integrate that check into \emph{hci\_send\_cmd}.

Listing \ref{HCIcmdExampleLocalName} illustrates how to set the device name with the HCI Write Local Name command.

Please note, that an application rarely has to send HCI commands on its own. All higher level functions in BTstack for the L2CAP and RFCOMM APIs manage this automatically. The main use of HCI commands in application is during the startup phase.

Independent from the number of output buffers, packet generation has to be adapted to the remote receiver and/or maximal link speed. Therefore, a packet can only be generated when it can get sent. With this assumption, the single output buffer design does not impose additional restrictions. In the following, we show how this is used for adapting the RFCOMM send rate. 

BTstack returns BTSTACK\_ACL\_BUFFERS\_FULL, if the outgoing buffer is full and RFCOMM\_NO\_OUTGOING\_CREDITS, if no outgoing credits are available. In Listing \ref{SingleOutputBufferTryToSend}, we show how to resend data packets when credits or outgoing buffers become available.

RFCOMM's mandatory credit-based flow-control imposes an additional constraint on sending a data packet - at least one new RFCOMM credit must be available. BTstack signals the availability of a credit by sending an RFCOMM credit (RFCOMM\_EVENT\_CREDITS) event. 

These two events represent two orthogonal mechanisms that deal with flow control. Taking these mechanisms in account, the application should try to send data packets when one of these two events is received, see Listing \ref{SingleOutputBufferTryPH} for a RFCOMM example.

\subsection{Become discoverable}
A remote unconnected Bluetooth device must be set as "discoverable" in order to be seen by a device performing the inquiry scan. To become discoverable, an application can call \emph{hci\_discoverable\_control}  with input parameter 1. If you want to provide a helpful name for your device, the application can set its local name by sending the $hci\_write\_local\_name$ command. To save energy, you may set the device as undiscoverable again, once a connection is established. See Listing \ref{Discoverable} for an example.


\subsection{Discover remote devices}
\label{section:DiscoverDevices}
To scan for remote devices, the \emph{hci\_inquiry} command is used. After that, the Bluetooth devices actively scans for other devices and reports these as part of HCI\_EVENT\_INQUIRY\_RESULT, HCI\_EVENT-\_INQUIRY\_RESULT\_WITH\_RSSI, or HCI\_EVENT\_EXTENDED\_INQUIRY\_RE-SPONSE events. Each response contains at least the Bluetooth address, the class of device, the page scan repetition mode, and the clock offset of found device. The latter events add information about the received signal strength or provide the Extended Inquiry Result (EIR). A code snippet is shown in Listing \ref{DiscoverDevices}.

By default, neither RSSI values nor EIR are reported. If the Bluetooth device implements Bluetooth Specification 2.1 or higher, the \emph{hci\_write\_inquiry\_mode} command enables reporting of this advanced features (0 for standard results, 1 for RSSI, 2 for RSSI and EIR). 

A complete GAP inquiry example is provided in Section \ref{example:GapInquiry}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float, caption=Discovering remote Bluetooth devices., label=DiscoverDevices]

\subsection{Pairing of devices}
By default, Bluetooth communication is not authenticated, and any device can talk to any other device. A Bluetooth device (for example, cellular phone) may choose to require authentication to provide a particular service (for example, a Dial-Up service). The process of establishing authentication is called pairing. Bluetooth provides two mechanism for this.

On Bluetooth devices that conform to the Bluetooth v2.0 or older specification, a PIN code (up to 16 bytes ASCII) has to be entered on both sides. This isn't optimal for embedded systems that do not have full I/O capabilities. To support pairing with older devices using a PIN, see Listing \ref{PinCodeRequest}.

The Bluetooth v2.1 specification introduces Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), which is a better approach as it both improves security and is better adapted to embedded system. With SSP, the devices first exchange their IO Capabilities and then settle on one of several ways to verify that the pairing is legitimate. If the Bluetooth device supports SSP, BTstack enables it by default and even automatically accepts SSP pairing requests. Depending on the product in which BTstack is used, this may not be desired and should be replaced with code to interact with the user.

Regardless of the authentication mechanism (PIN/SSP), on success, both devices will generate a link key. The link key can be stored either in the Bluetooth module itself or in a persistent storage, see Section \ref{section:persistent_storage}. The next time the device connect and request an authenticated connection, both devices can use the previously generated link key. Please note that the pairing must be repeated if the link key is lost by one device.

\subsection{Access an L2CAP service on a remote device}
L2CAP is based around the concept of channels. A channel is a logical connection on top of a baseband connection. Each channel is bound to a single protocol in a many-to-one fashion. Multiple channels can be bound to the same protocol, but a channel cannot be bound to multiple protocols. Multiple channels can share the same baseband connection.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=L2CAP handler for outgoing L2CAP channel.,label=L2CAPremoteService]
btstack_packet_handler_t l2cap_packet_handler;

void btstack_setup(){
    ...
    l2cap_init();
}

void create_outgoing_l2cap_channel(bd_addr_t address, uint16_t psm, uint16_t mtu){
     l2cap_create_channel_internal(NULL, l2cap_packet_handler, remote_bd_addr, psm, mtu);
}

void l2cap_packet_handler(uint8_t packet_type, uint16_t channel, uint8_t *packet, uint16_t size){
    if (packet_type == HCI_EVENT_PACKET &&
          packet[0] == L2CAP_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED){
        if (packet[2]) {
            printf("Connection failed\n\r");
            return;
        }
        printf("Connected\n\r");
    }
    if (packet_type == L2CAP_DATA_PACKET){
        // handle L2CAP data packet
        return;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}


To communicate with an L2CAP service on a remote device, the application on a local Bluetooth device initiates the L2CAP layer using the \emph{l2cap\_init} function, and then creates an outgoing L2CAP channel to the PSM of a remote device using the \emph{l2cap\_create\_channel\_internal} function. The  \emph{l2cap\_-create\_channel\_internal} function will initiate a new baseband connection if it does not already exist. The packet handler that is given as an input parameter of the L2CAP create channel function will be assigned to the new outgoing L2CAP channel. This handler receives the L2CAP\_EVENT\_CHANNEL\_OPENED and L2CAP\_EVENT\_CHAN-NEL\_CLOSED events and L2CAP data packets, as shown in Listing \ref{L2CAPremoteService}.


\subsection{Provide an L2CAP service}

To provide an L2CAP service, the application on a local Bluetooth device must init the L2CAP layer and register the service with \emph{l2cap\_register\_service\_internal}. From there on, it can wait for incoming L2CAP connections. The application can accept or deny an incoming connection by calling the \emph{l2cap\_accept\_connection\_internal} and \emph{l2cap\_deny\_connection\_internal} functions respectively. If a connection is accepted and the incoming L2CAP channel gets successfully opened, the L2CAP service can send L2CAP data packets to the connected device with \emph{l2cap\_send\_internal}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Providing an L2CAP service., label=L2CAPService]
void btstack_setup(){
    ...
    l2cap_init();
    l2cap_register_service_internal(NULL, packet_handler, 0x11,100);
}

void packet_handler (uint8_t packet_type, uint16_t channel, uint8_t *packet, uint16_t size){
      ...
      if (packet_type == L2CAP_DATA_PACKET){
        // handle L2CAP data packet
        return;
    }
    switch(event){
        ...
        case L2CAP_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION:
            bt_flip_addr(event_addr, &packet[2]);
            handle     = READ_BT_16(packet, 8); 
            psm        = READ_BT_16(packet, 10); 
            local_cid  = READ_BT_16(packet, 12); 
            printf("L2CAP incoming connection requested.");
            l2cap_accept_connection_internal(local_cid);
            break;
        case L2CAP_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED:
            bt_flip_addr(event_addr, &packet[3]);
            psm = READ_BT_16(packet, 11); 
            local_cid = READ_BT_16(packet, 13); 
            handle = READ_BT_16(packet, 9);
            if (packet[2] == 0) {
                printf("Channel successfully opened.");
            } else {
                printf("L2CAP connection failed. status code.");
            }
            break;        
        case L2CAP_EVENT_CREDITS:
        case DAEMON_EVENT_HCI_PACKET_SENT:
            tryToSend();

        case L2CAP_EVENT_CHANNEL_CLOSED:
            break;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Sending of L2CAP data packets may fail due to a full internal BTstack outgoing packet buffer, or if the ACL buffers in the Bluetooth module become full, i.e., if the application is sending faster than the packets can be transferred over the air. In such case, the application can try sending again upon reception of DAEMON\_EVENT\_HCI\_PACKET\_SENT or L2CAP\_EVENT\_CREDITS event. The first event signals that the internal BTstack outgoing buffer became free again, the second one signals the same for ACL buffers in the Bluetooth chipset. Listing \ref{L2CAPService} provides L2CAP service example code.

\subsection{Access an RFCOMM service on a remote device}

To communicate with an RFCOMM service on a remote device, the application on a local Bluetooth device initiates the RFCOMM layer using the \emph{rfcomm\_init} function, and then creates an outgoing RFCOMM channel to a given server channel on a remote device using the \emph{rfcomm\_create\_channel\_internal} function. The  \emph{rfcomm\_create\_channel\_intern-al} function will initiate a new L2CAP connection for the RFCOMM multiplexer, if it does not already exist. The channel will automatically provide enough credits to the remote side. To provide credits manually, you have to create the RFCOMM connection by calling \emph{rfcomm\_create\_channel\_with\_initial\_credits\_internal} - see Section \ref{sec:manualCredits}.


The packet handler that is given as an input parameter of the RFCOMM create channel function will be assigned to the new outgoing \mbox{RFCOMM} channel. This handler receives the RFCOMM\_EVENT\_OPEN\_CHAN-NEL\_COMPLETE and RFCOMM\_EVENT\_CHANNEL\_CLOSED events, and RFCOMM data packets, as shown in Listing \ref{RFCOMMremoteService}.

\subsection{Provide an RFCOMM service}
\label{section:rfcomm_service}

To provide an RFCOMM service, the application on a local Bluetooth device must first init the L2CAP and RFCOMM layers and then register the service with \emph{rfcomm\_register\_service\_internal}. From there on, it can wait for incoming RFCOMM connections. The application can accept or deny an incoming connection by calling the \emph{rfcomm\_accept\_connection-\_internal} and \emph{rfcomm\_deny\_connection\_internal} functions respectively. If a connection is accepted and the incoming RFCOMM channel gets successfully opened, the RFCOMM service can send RFCOMM data packets to the connected device with \emph{rfcomm\_send\_internal} and receive data packets by the packet handler provided by the \emph{rfcomm\_register\_service\_internal} call.

Sending of RFCOMM data packets may fail due to a full internal BTstack outgoing packet buffer, or if the ACL buffers in the Bluetooth module become full, i.e., if the application is sending faster than the packets can be transferred over the air. In such case, the application can try sending again upon reception of DAEMON\_EVENT\_HCI\_PACKET\_SENT or RFCOMM\_EVENT\_CREDITS event. The first event signals that the internal BTstack outgoing buffer became free again, the second one signals that the remote side allowed to send another  packet. Listing \ref{RFCOMMService} provides the RFCOMM service example code.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= RFCOMM service with automatic credit management. , label=automaticFlowControl]

\subsection{Slowing down RFCOMM data reception}
\label{sec:manualCredits}
RFCOMM has a mandatory credit-based flow-control that can be used to adapt, i.e., slow down the RFCOMM data to your processing speed. 
For incoming data, BTstack provides channels and services with and without automatic credit management. 
If the management of credits is automatic, see Listing \ref{automaticFlowControl},  new credits are provided when needed relying on ACL flow control. This is only useful if there is not much data transmitted and/or only one physical connection is used

% \end{minipage}

If the management of credits is manual, credits are provided by the application such that it can manage its receive buffers explicitly, see Listing \ref{explicitFlowControl}.

Manual credit management is recommended when received RFCOMM data cannot be processed immediately. In the SPP flow control example in Section \ref{example:spp_flow_control}, delayed processing of received data is simulated with the help of a periodic timer. To provide new credits, you call the \emph{rfcomm\_grant\_credits} function with the RFCOMM channel ID and the number of credits as shown in Listing \ref{NewCredits}.
Please note that providing single credits effectively reduces the credit-based (sliding window) flow control to a stop-and-wait flow-control that limits the data throughput substantially. On the plus side, it allows for a minimal memory footprint. If possible, multiple RFCOMM buffers should be used to avoid pauses while the sender has to wait for a new credit.

\subsection{Create SDP records}
BTstack contains a complete SDP server and allows to register SDP records. An SDP record is a list of SDP Attribute \emph{\{ID, Value\}} pairs that are stored in a Data Element Sequence (DES). The Attribute ID is a 16-bit number, the value can be of other simple types like integers or strings or can itselff contain other DES. 


To create an SDP record for an SPP service, you can call \emph{sdp\_create\_spp\_service} from \path{src/sdp_util.c} with a pointer to a buffer to store the record, the \mbox{RFCOMM} server channel number, and a record name. 

For other types of records, you can use the other functions in \path{src/sdp_util.c}, using the data element \emph{de\_*} functions.  Listing \ref{sdpCreate} shows how an SDP record containing two SDP attributes can be created. First, a DES is created and then the Service Record Handle and Service Class ID List attributes are added to it. The Service Record Handle attribute is added by calling the \emph{de\_add\_number} function twice: the first time to add 0x0000 as attribute ID, and the second time to add the actual record handle (here 0x1000) as attribute value. The Service Class ID List attribute has ID 0x0001, and it requires a list of UUIDs as attribute value. To create the list, \emph{de\_push\_sequence} is called, which "opens" a sub-DES. The returned pointer is used to add elements to this sub-DES. After adding all UUIDs, the sub-DES is "closed" with \emph{de\_pop\_sequence}.

\subsection{Query remote SDP service}

BTstack provides an SDP client to query SDP services of a remote device. The SDP Client API  is shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:api_sdp_client}. The \emph{sdp\_client\_query} function initiates an L2CAP connection to the remote SDP server. Upon connect, a \emph{Service Search Attribute} request with a \emph{Service Search Pattern} and a \emph{Attribute ID List} is sent. The result of the \emph{Service Search Attribute} query contains a list of \emph{Service Records}, and each of them contains the requested attributes. These records are handled by the SDP parser. The parser delivers SDP\_PARSER\_ATTRIBUTE\_VALUE and SDP\_PARSER\_COMPLETE events via a registered callback. The SDP\_PARSER\_ATTRIBUTE\_VALUE event delivers the attribute value byte by byte.

On top of this, you can implement specific SDP queries. For example, BTstack provides a query for RFCOMM service name and channel number. This information is needed, e.g., if you want to connect to a remote SPP service. The query delivers all matching RFCOMM services, including its name and the channel number, as well as a query complete  event via a registered callback, as shown in Listing \ref{SDPClientRFCOMM}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Searching RFCOMM services on a remote device., label=SDPClientRFCOMM ]

     \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

In all examples the debug UART port is configured at 57600 bps speed. 

\subsection{led\_counter: UART and timer interrupt without Bluetooth}
The example demonstrates how to setup hardware, initialize BTstack without Bluetooth, provide a periodic timer to toggle an LED and print number of toggles as a minimal BTstack test.

\subsubsection{Periodic Timer Setup}
$ $
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Periodic counter, label=LEDToggler]
void heartbeat_handler(timer_source_t *ts){
    // increment counter
    char lineBuffer[30];
    sprintf(lineBuffer, "BTstack counter %04u\n\r", ++counter);
    printf(lineBuffer);
    
    // toggle LED
    LED_PORT_OUT = LED_PORT_OUT ^ LED_2;
    
    // re-register timer
    run_loop_register_timer(ts, HEARTBEAT_PERIOD_MS);
} 
\end{lstlisting}

As timers in BTstack are single shot, the periodic counter is implemented by re-registering the \emph{timer\_source} in the \emph{heartbeat\_handler} callback function. The general setup is explained in Section \ref{section:periodicTimer}. Listing \ref{LEDToggler} shows \emph{heartbeat\_handler} adapted to periodically toggle an LED and print number of toggles.


\subsubsection{Turn On and Go}

Listing \ref{RunLoopExecution} shows how to setup and start the run loop. For hardware and BTstack setup, please check the source code. 

\begin{lstlisting}[float, caption= Run loop execution., label=RunLoopExecution]
void timer_setup(){
    // set one-shot timer
    heartbeat.process = &timer_handler;
    run_loop_register_timer(&heartbeat, HEARTBEAT_PERIOD_MS);
}

int main(void){
    hw_setup();
    btstack_setup();
    timer_setup();
    
    // go!
    run_loop_execute(); 
    
    // happy compiler!
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

    
\subsection{gap\_inquiry: GAP Inquiry Example}
\label{example:GapInquiry}

The Generic Access Profile (GAP) defines how Bluetooth devices discover and establish a connection with each other. In this example, the application discovers  surrounding Bluetooth devices and collects their Class of Device (CoD), page scan mode, clock offset, and RSSI. After that, the remote name of each device is requested. In the following section we outline the Bluetooth logic part, i.e., how the packet handler handles the asynchronous events and data packets.

\subsubsection{Bluetooth Logic}
The Bluetooth logic is implemented as a state machine within the packet handler. In this example, the following states are passed sequentially: INIT, W4\_INQUIRY\_MODE\_COMPLETE, and ACTIVE. 

In INIT, the application enables the extended inquiry mode, which includes RSSI values, and transits to W4\_INQUIRY\_MODE\_COMPLETE state.

In W4\_INQUIRY\_MODE\_COMPLETE, after the inquiry mode was set, an inquiry scan is started, and the application transits to ACTIVE state. 

IN ACTIVE, the following events are processed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inquiry result event: the list of discovered devices is processed and the Class of Device (CoD), page scan mode, clock offset, and RSSI are stored in a table.
\item Inquiry complete event: the remote name is requested for devices without a fetched name. The state of a remote name can be one of the following: REMOTE\_NAME\_REQUEST, REMOTE\_NAME\_INQUIRED, or REMOTE\_NAME\_FETCHED.
\item Remote name cached event: prints cached remote names provided by BTstack - if persistent storage is provided.
\item Remote name request complete event: the remote name is stored in the table and the state is updated to REMOTE\_NAME\_FETCHED. The query of remote names is continued.
\end{itemize}

For more details please check Section \ref{section:DiscoverDevices} and the source code.

\subsection {spp\_counter: SPP Server - Heartbeat Counter over RFCOMM}
\label{section:sppcounter}
    The Serial port profile (SPP) is widely used as it provides a serial port over Bluetooth. The SPP counter example demonstrates how to setup an SPP service, and provide a periodic timer over RFCOMM. 
    
 \subsubsection{SPP Service Setup}
    
    SPP is based on RFCOMM, a Bluetooth protocol that emulates RS-232 serial ports. To access an RFCOMM serial port on a remote device, a client has to query its Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) server. The SDP response for an SPP service contains the RFCOMM channel number. To provide an SPP service, you need to initialize memory (Section \ref{section:memory_configuration}) and the run loop (Section \ref{section:run_loop}), setup HCI (Section \ref{section:btstack_initialization}) and L2CAP, then register an RFCOMM service and provide its RFCOMM channel number as part of the Protocol List attribute of the SDP record . Example code for SPP service setup is provided in Listing \ref{SPPSetup}. The SDP record created by $sdp\_create\_spp\_service$ consists of a basic SPP definition that uses provided RFCOMM channel ID and service name. For more details, please have a look at it in \path{include/btstack/sdp_util.c}. The SDP record is created on the fly in RAM and is deterministic. To preserve valuable RAM, the result can be stored as constant data inside the ROM.

    
\subsubsection{Periodic Timer Setup}

The heartbeat handler increases the real counter every second, as shown in Listing \ref{PeriodicCounter}. The general setup is explained in Section \ref{section:periodicTimer}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Periodic counter, label=PeriodicCounter]
#define HEARTBEAT_PERIOD_MS 1000

void  theartbeat_handler(timer_source_t *ts){
    real_counter++;
    // re-register timer
    run_loop_register_timer(ts, HEARTBEAT_PERIOD_MS);
} 

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Bluetooth logic}
The Bluetooth logic is implemented as a state machine within the packet handler, see Listing \ref{SppServerPacketHandler}. In this example, the following states are passed sequentially: INIT, W4\_CONNECTION, W4\_CHANNEL\_COMPLETE, and ACTIVE.

\begin{lstlisting}[float, caption=SPP Server - Heartbeat Counter over RFCOMM., label=SppServerPacketHandler]
void prepareData(void){
   counter_to_send++;
}

void tryToSend(void){
    // see Quick Recipe 5.4, Listing 8
}

void packet_handler (uint8_t packet_type, uint8_t *packet, uint16_t size){
    ...    
    switch(state){
        case INIT:
            if (packet[2] == HCI_STATE_WORKING) {
                hci_send_cmd(&hci_write_local_name, "BTstack Demo");
                state = W4_CONNECTION;
            }
            break;

        case W4_CONNECTION:
            switch (event) {
                case HCI_EVENT_PIN_CODE_REQUEST:
                    // see Quick Recipe 5.7
                    break;
                case RFCOMM_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION:
                    // see Quick Recipe 5.11
                    state = W4_CHANNEL_COMPLETE;
                    break;
            }
        
        case W4_CHANNEL_COMPLETE:
            if (event != RFCOMM_EVENT_OPEN_CHANNEL_COMPLETE) break;
            // see Quick Recipe 5.11
            // state: W4_CONNECTION on failure, otherwise ACTIVE
            break;
        
        case ACTIVE:
            // see Quick Recipe 5.4, Listing 9
            // state: W4_CONNECTION on channel closed
            break;
        ...
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

In INIT, upon successful startup of BTstack, the local Bluetooth name is set, and the state machine transits to W4\_CONNECTION.

The W4\_CONNECTION state handles authentication and accepts incoming RFCOMM connections. It uses a fixed PIN code "0000" for authentication. An incoming RFCOMM  connection is accepted, and the state machine progresses to W4\_CHANNEL\_COMPLETE.  More logic is need, if you want to handle connections from multiple clients. The incoming RFCOMM connection event contains the RFCOMM channel number used during the SPP setup phase and the newly assigned RFCOMM channel ID that is used by all BTstack commands and events. 

In W4\_CHANNEL\_COMPLETE state, an error in the channel establishment fails (rare case, e.g., client crashes), the application returns to the W4\_CONNE-CTION state. On successful connection, the RFCOMM channel ID and MTU for this channel are made available to the heartbeat counter and the state machine transits to ACTIVE.

While in the ACTIVE state, the communication between client and the application takes place. In this example, the timer handler increases the real counter every second. The packet handler tries to send this information when an RFCOMM credit (RFCOMM\_EVENT\_CREDITS) or an HCI packet sent event (DAEMON\_EVENT\_HCI\_PACKET\_SENT) are received. These two events represent two orthogonal mechanisms that deal with flow control. A packet can only be sent when an RFCOMM credit is available and the internal BTstack outgoing packet buffer is free.


%*************************************
\subsection{spp\_accel: SPP Server - Accelerator Values}
In this example, the server tries to send the current accelerometer values. It does not use a periodic timer, instead, it sends the data as fast as possible. 


%*************************************
\subsection {spp\_flowcontrol: SPP Server - Flow Control}
\label{example:spp_flow_control}
This example adds explicit flow control for incoming RFCOMM data to the SPP heartbeat counter example. We will highlight the changes compared to the SPP counter example. 

\subsubsection{SPP Service Setup}

Listing \ref{explicitFlowControl} shows how to provide one initial credit during RFCOMM service initialization. Please note that providing a single credit effectively reduces the credit-based (sliding window) flow control to a stop-and-wait flow control that limits the data throughput substantially.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= Heartbeat handler with manual credit management. , label=hbhManual]
void  heartbeat_handler(struct timer *ts){
    if (rfcomm_send_credit){
        rfcomm_grant_credits(rfcomm_channel_id, 1);
        rfcomm_send_credit = 0;
    }
    run_loop_register_timer(ts, HEARTBEAT_PERIOD_MS);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= Packet handler with manual credit management. , label=phManual]
void packet_handler (void * connection, uint8_t packet_type, uint16_t channel, uint8_t *packet, uint16_t size){
    ...
    if (packet_type == RFCOMM_DATA_PACKET){
        packet[size] = 0;
        puts( (const char *) packet);
        rfcomm_send_credit = 1;
        return;
    }
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Periodic Timer Setup}

Explicit credit management is recommended when received RFCOMM data cannot be processed immediately. In this example, delayed processing of received data is simulated with the help of a periodic timer as follows. When the packet handler receives a data packet, it does not provide a new credit, it sets a flag instead. If the flag is set, a new credit will be granted by the heartbeat handler, introducing a delay of up to 1 second. The heartbeat handler code is shown in Listing \ref{hbhManual}. The general setup is explained in Section \ref{section:periodicTimer}.

%*************************************

\subsection {ble\_server: LE Peripheral}
\label{example:ble_browser}

This example shows how to create an LE peripheral. The peripheral can be discovered by other devices and provides a GATT Server. The GATT server allows to discover the primary services, and read and write their characteristics. The BTstack setup code is written for a PAN1323 or 1326 module with a CC2564 chipset.

\subsection {gatt\_browser: GATT Client - Discovering primary services and their characteristics}
\label{example:gatt_browser}
This example shows how to use the GATT Client API to discover primary services and their characteristics of the first found device that is advertising its services.

The logic is divided between the HCI and GATT client packet handlers. The HCI packet handler with its state machine is responsible for finding and connecting to a remote device, and for starting the first GATT client query. Then, the GATT client packet handler receives all primary services and requests the characteristics of the last one to keep the example short.

\subsubsection{Setting up GATT client}
In setup phase, a GATT client must register the HCI and GATT client packet handlers, as shown in Listing \ref{code:gattClientSetup}. Additionally, the security manager can be setup, if signed writes, or encrypted or authenticated connection, are required to access the characteristics, as explained in Section \ref{section:security_manager}.  

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= Setting up GATT client., label=code:gattClientSetup]
typedef enum {
  IDLE,
  W4_SCAN_RESULT,
  W4_CONNECT,
  W4_SERVICE_RESULT,
  W4_CHARACTERISTIC_RESULT,
  W4_DISCONNECT
} gc_state_t;

gc_state_t state = TC_IDLE;
uint16_t gc_id;

// Handles connect, disconnect, and advertising report events,  
// starts the GATT client, and sends the first query.
void handle_hci_event(void * connection, uint8_t packet_type, uint16_t channel, uint8_t *packet, uint16_t size);

// Handles GATT client query results, sends queries and the 
// GAP disconnect command when the querying is done.
void handle_gatt_client_event(le_event_t * event);

void setup(void){
  ...
  // Initialize L2CAP and register HCI event handler
  l2cap_init();
  l2cap_register_packet_handler(&handle_hci_event);

  // Initialize GATT client and register handler for GATT client
  // events
  gatt_client_init();
  gc_id = gatt_client_register_packet_handler(&handle_gatt_client_event);  
  
  // Optionally, setup security manager for signed writes or 
  // encrypted or authenticated connection
  sm_init();
  sm_set_io_capabilities(IO_CAPABILITY_NO_INPUT_NO_OUTPUT);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Packet handlers}
The GATT browser goes sequentially through the states: IDLE, W4\_SCAN\_RESULT, W4\_CONNECT,  W4\_SERVICE\_RESULT,  
\\ W4\_CHARACTERISTIC\_RESULT, and W4\_DISCONNECT. 

The W4\_SERVICE\_RESULT and W4\_CHARACTERISTIC\_RESULT states compose the state machine of the GATT client packet handler, as it reacts on GATT client events. The other states compose the state machine of the HCI packet handler.

In detail, the HCI packet handler has to start the scanning, to find the first advertising device, to stop scanning, to connect to and later to disconnect from it, to start the gatt client upon the connection is completed, and to send the first query - in this case the \emph{gatt\_client\_discover\_primary\_services} query is called, see Listing \ref{code:gattBrowserHCIPacketHandler}. A convenience function for filling advertising report struct from data packet is shown in Listing \ref{code:gattBrowserAdvReport}. 

Query results and further queries are handled by the gatt client packet handler, as shown in Listing \ref{code:gattBrowserQueryHandler}. Here, upon receiving the primary services,  the \emph{gatt\_client\_discover\_characteristics\_for\_service} query for the last received service is sent. After receiving the characteristics for the service, the \emph{gap\_disconnect} is called to terminate the connection. Upon disconnect, the HCI packet handler receives the disconnect complete event, and has to call \emph{gatt\_client\_stop} function to remove the disconnected device from the list of active GATT clients.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= Advertising report handling., label=code:gattBrowserHCIPacketHandler]

\section{Porting to Other Platforms}

In this chapter, we highlight the BTstack components that need to be adjusted for different hardware platforms.
\subsection{Tick Hardware Abstraction Layer}
\label{section:tickAbstraction}

BTstack requires a way to learn about passing time. In an embedded configuration, the following functions have to be provided. The \emph{hal\_tick\_init} and the \emph{hal\_tick\_set\_handler} functions will be called during the initialization of the run loop.
 
 \begin{lstlisting}
void hal_tick_init(void);
void hal_tick_set_handler(void (*tick_handler)(void));
int  hal_tick_get_tick_period_in_ms(void);
 \end{lstlisting}
 
\subsection{Bluetooth Hardware Control API}
\label{section:bt_hw_control}
The Bluetooth hardware control API can provide the HCI layer with a custom initialization script, a vendor-specific baud rate change command, and system power notifications. It is also used to control the power mode of the Bluetooth module, i.e., turning it on/off and putting to sleep. In addition, it provides an error handler \emph{hw\_error} that is called when a Hardware Error is reported by the Bluetooth module. The callback allows for persistent logging or signaling of this failure. \todo{add recipe}

Overall, the struct \emph{bt\_control\_t} encapsulates common functionality that is not covered by the Bluetooth specification. As an example, the \emph{bt\_control\_cc256x\_in-stance} function returns a pointer to a control struct suitable for the CC256x chipset.

 \subsection{HCI Transport Implementation}
 \label{section:hci_transport}
On embedded systems, a Bluetooth module can be connected via USB or an UART port. BTstack implements two UART based protocols for carrying HCI commands, events and data between a host and a Bluetooth module: HCI UART Transport Layer (H4) and H4 with eHCILL support, a lightweight low-power variant by Texas Instruments.

 \subsubsection{HCI UART Transport Layer (H4)}
 \label{section:hciUART}
Most embedded UART interfaces operate on the byte level and generate a processor interrupt when a byte was received. In the interrupt handler, common UART drivers then place the received data in a ring buffer and set a flag for further processing or notify the higher-level code, i.e., in our case the Bluetooth stack.

Bluetooth communication is packet-based and a single packet may contain up to 1021 bytes. Calling a data received handler of the Bluetooth stack for every byte creates an unnecessary overhead. To avoid that, a Bluetooth packet can be read as multiple blocks where the amount of bytes to read is known in advance. Even better would be the use of on-chip DMA modules for these block reads, if available.

%During the BTstack will request up to three reads: first to get the packet type, second to get ACL or Event header, and last one to read the payload. 

The BTstack UART Hardware Abstraction Layer API reflects this design approach and the underlying UART driver has to implement the following API:

 \begin{lstlisting}
void hal_uart_dma_init(void);
void hal_uart_dma_set_block_received(void (*block_handler)(void));
void hal_uart_dma_set_block_sent(void (*block_handler)(void));
int  hal_uart_dma_set_baud(uint32_t baud);
void hal_uart_dma_send_block(const uint8_t *buffer, uint16_t len);
void hal_uart_dma_receive_block(uint8_t *buffer, uint16_t len);
 \end{lstlisting}
 
The main HCI H4 implementations for embedded system is \emph{hci\_h4\_transport-\_dma} function. This function calls the following sequence: \emph{hal\_uart\_dma\_init}, \emph{hal\_uart\_dma\_set\_block\_received} and \emph{hal\_uart\_dma\_set\_block\_sent} functions. \mbox{After} this sequence, the HCI layer will start packet processing by calling \emph{hal\_uart-\_dma\_receive\_block} function. The HAL implementation is responsible for reading the requested amount of bytes, stopping incoming data via the RTS line when the requested amount of data was received and has to call the handler. By this, the HAL implementation can stay generic, while requiring only three callbacks per HCI packet. 

\subsubsection{H4 with eHCILL support}
With the standard H4 protocol interface, it is not possible for either the host nor the baseband controller to enter a sleep mode. Besides the official H5 protocol, various chip vendors came up with proprietary solutions to this. The eHCILL support by Texas Instruments allows both the host and the baseband controller to independently enter sleep mode without loosing their synchronization with the HCI H4 Transport Layer. In addition to the IRQ-driven block-wise RX and TX, eHCILL requires a callback for CTS interrupts.

\begin{lstlisting}
void hal_uart_dma_set_cts_irq_handler(void(*cts_irq_handler)(void));
void hal_uart_dma_set_sleep(uint8_t sleep);
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Persistent Storage API}
\label{section:persistent_storage}

On embedded systems there is no generic way to persist data like link keys or remote device names, as every type of a device has its own capabilities, particularities and limitations. The persistent storage API provides an interface to implement concrete drivers for a particular system. As an example and for testing purposes, BTstack provides the memory-only implementation \emph{remote\_device\_db\_memory}. An implementation has to conform to the interface in Listing \ref{persistentDB}.
\\

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Persistent Storage Interface., label=persistentDB]
typedef struct {
    // management
    void (*open)();
    void (*close)();
    
    // link key
    int  (*get_link_key)(bd_addr_t *bd_addr, link_key_t *link_key);
    void (*put_link_key)(bd_addr_t *bd_addr, link_key_t *key);
    void (*delete_link_key)(bd_addr_t *bd_addr);
    
    // remote name
    int (*get_name)(bd_addr_t *bd_addr, device_name_t *device_name);
    void(*put_name)(bd_addr_t *bd_addr, device_name_t *device_name);
    void(*delete_name)(bd_addr_t *bd_addr);
} remote_device_db_t;

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Integrating with Existing Systems}

While the run loop provided by BTstack is sufficient for new designs, BTstack is often used with or added to existing projects. In this case, the run loop, data sources, and timers may need to be adapted. The following two sections provides a guideline for single and multi-threaded environments.

To simplify the discussion, we'll consider an application split into "Main \mbox{Application}", "Communication Logic", and "BTstack". The Communication Logic contains the packet handler (PH) that handles all asynchronous events and data packets from BTstack. The Main Application makes use of the Communication Logic for its Bluetooth communication.

\subsection{Adapting BTstack for Single-Threaded Environments}
\label{section:singlethreading}

In a single-threaded environment, all application components run on the same (single) thread and use direct function calls as shown in Figure \ref{fig:BTstackSingle}.

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{picts/singlethreading-btstack.pdf} 
   \caption{BTstack in single-threaded environment. }
   \label{fig:BTstackSingle}
\end{figure}

BTstack provides a basic run loop that supports the concept of data sources and timers, which can be registered centrally. This works well when working with a small MCU and without an operating system.
To adapt to a basic operating system or a different scheduler, BTstack's run loop can be implemented based on the functions and mechanism of the existing system. 

Currently, we have two examples for this:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{run\_loop\_cocoa.c} is an implementation for the CoreFoundation Framework used in OS X and iOS. All run loop functions are implemented in terms of CoreFoundation calls, data sources and timers are modeled as CFSockets and CFRunLoopTimer respectively. 
\item \emph{run\_loop\_posix.c} is an implementation for POSIX compliant systems. The data sources are modeled as file descriptors and managed in a linked list. Then, the\emph{select} function is used to wait for the next file descriptor to become ready or timer to expire. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adapting BTstack for Multi-Threaded Environments}
\label{section:multithreading}

The basic execution model of BTstack is a general while loop. Aside from interrupt-driven UART and timers, everything happens in sequence. 
When using BTstack in a multi-threaded environment,  this assumption has to stay valid - at least with respect to BTstack. For this, there are two common options:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}
\centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{picts/multithreading-monolithic.pdf} 
   \caption{BTstack in multi-threaded environment - monolithic solution.}
   \label{fig:BTstackMonolithic}
\vspace{0.8cm}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}
\centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{picts/multithreading-btdaemon.pdf} 
   \caption{BTstack in multi-threaded environment - solution with daemon.}
   \label{fig:BTstackDaemon}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Communication Logic is implemented on a dedicated BTstack thread, and the Main Application communicates with the BTstack thread via application-specific messages over an Interprocess Communication (IPC) as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:BTstackMonolithic}. This option results in less code and quick adaption.
\item BTstack must be extended to run standalone, i.e, as a Daemon, on a dedicated thread and the Main Application controls this daemon via BTstack extended HCI command over IPC - this is used for the non-embedded version of BTstack e.g., on the iPhone and it is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:BTstackDaemon}. This option requires more code but provides more flexibility.
\end{itemize}
