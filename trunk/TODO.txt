/* new todo file for BTstack */

2009-11-08: Release 0.1

NEXT:
- suport multiple signaling commands in single ACL packet
  - have l2cap_primary_signaling_handler use offsets relative to start of commands (byte 8) instead of start of packet
  - call l2cap_primary_signaling_handler for each command
- add extern "C" to bstack methods
  - see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/376966/using-c-c-static-libraries-from-iphone-objectivec-apps
- clean up control flow
  - l2cap directly sends data over socket: good/bad?
  - split daemon into stack parts
  - should there be STACK API/interface?
- BUG: bt_close crashes when used in CocoaTouch app
- Provide BTstackManager Objective-C class
  - move connection methods to BTdevice (get more object oriented)
    - initWithAddress:(bd_addr_t *)addr
	- setters private
  - implement l2cap code
  - implement rfcomm code
  - animate discovery dialog:
      * use indexPathsForVisibleRows and cellForRowAtIndexPath: when you want to refresh just the cells that are on the screen
      * use insertRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: to add rows
      * use deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: to remove them-
- figure out how to receive iPhone System Power IONotifications (in BTdaemon) to detect, when phone gets locked
  - some trick
  - use Cocoa run loop for background app?
- move RFCOMM code into BTdaemon
- add timeouts to cocoa run loop
- L2CAP 
  - segmentation

- extend SpringBoard feedback
  - show alerts/messages using SpringBoardAcccess, e.g. Bluetooth disconnected by remote device
  - add code to notify about remote disconnets
- configuration: /etc/btstack
  - single Bluetooth module supported
  - transport type: H4, H5, USB
  - h4/h5: UART path
  - usb: product/vendor ID
  - logging mode: text, bluez, packetlogger
- implement rest of L2CAP state machine
  - error handling
  - error notification
  - flow control
- add configure option for uart flowcontrol
- create <btstack/errors.h>
