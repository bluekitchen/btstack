- Talk
  - 1 Titel, 1 Motivation, 1 Slide Architecture, 1 Slide Status, 1 Demo
  
NEXT:
- l2cap state machine
  - disconnect channel
- automatic L2CAP & higher disconnects
  - when client connection breaks, also close open L2CAP channels
=== Restart client app without restarting BTdaemon
- handle HCI link disconnect
  - broadcast l2cap disconnects,too
- implement timers for POSIX run loop
- automatic HCI link disconnect
  - periodically close HCI connections without active L2CAP channel
=== BTdaemon can run always
- implement rest of L2CAP state machine
  - incoming connections
=== Incoming L2CAP supported
- client/server part using unix domain sockets (portable and fast)
- implement rest of L2CAP state machine
  - error handling
  - error notification
  - flow control
  - reassembly/segmentation
- DEMOS:
  - BTstack-cmd
    - info
	- inquiry
	- remote name
	- open/close l2cap connection
    - evtl. SDP browser

== Release Version 0.1
- implement RFCOMM
- implement SDP
- implement PAN

== Release Version 0.2
- naming conventions for various layers
  - if all control is done by pseudo hci commands, only bt_send_cmd(&cmd_name, ... ) is needed anyway
- auto-generate code for sending commands from structured text input file
- devise concept for access to event data
  - auto-generate event struct getter? STRUCTURE_get_FIELD
