/* new todo file for BTstack */

2009-11-08: Release 0.1
2010-06-20: Release 0.2 - SDP + iOS 4 support

NEXT:
- test SDP implementation against Mac/Linux Service Discovery
- HCI CMD packet is limited to 255 bytes payload. SDP records can be larger than that. Options:
  - handle SDP records in client library
  - provide a way to transer SDP records in segments
  - ignore HCI command lenght on socket connection and directly stream data without buffer
  - use simple SDP_PACKET for client/server communication

- move RFCOMM code into BTdaemon
- add extern "C" to bstack methods
  - see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/376966/using-c-c-static-libraries-from-iphone-objectivec-apps
- figure out how to receive iPhone System Power IONotifications (in BTdaemon) to detect, when phone gets locked
- add timeouts to cocoa run loop
- L2CAP 
  - segmentation
- extend SpringBoard feedback
  - show alerts/messages using SpringBoardAcccess, e.g. Bluetooth disconnected by remote device
  - add code to notify about remote disconnets
- configuration: /etc/btstack
  - single Bluetooth module supported
  - transport type: H4, H5, USB
  - h4/h5: UART path
  - usb: product/vendor ID
  - logging mode: text, bluez, packetlogger
- implement rest of L2CAP state machine
  - error handling
  - error notification
  - flow control
- add configure option for uart flowcontrol
- create <btstack/errors.h>
- Bluetooth low-power modes useful

== USB Support ==
- Store array of data sources to be able to remove them on usb_close

== Objective-C Interface ==
- move connection methods to BTdevice (get more object oriented)
  - initWithAddress:(bd_addr_t *)addr
  - setters private
- implement l2cap code
- implement rfcomm code
- animate discovery dialog:
  * use indexPathsForVisibleRows and cellForRowAtIndexPath: when you want to refresh just the cells that are on the screen
  * use insertRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: to add rows
  * use deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: to remove them-

== Refactor/Improve Architecture ==
- use single standard packet handler for acl & events 
  - hci_transport -> hci
  - hci -> l2cap
  - l2cap -> daemon 
- add linked_list_iterator that can remove elements (used by l2cap_close_connection and sdp_unregister_services_for_connection
- clean up control flow
  - l2cap directly sends data over socket: good/bad?
  - split daemon into stack parts
  - should there be STACK API/interface?
- unify packet generation
  - btstack events
  - cmd packets
  - l2cap commands
- auto-generate code for sending commands from structured text input file
- devise concept for access to event data
  - auto-generate event struct getter? STRUCTURE_get_FIELD
