/* new todo file for BTstack */

Last milestone reached: Restart client app without restarting BTdaemon possible

NEXT:
- turn off Bluetooth on ctrl-c
- extend hci_logger to write to /var/hci_dump.txt as text
- automatic start/stop of BTdaemon
  - start BTdaemon by client lib
    - e.g. use popen and wait for initial "I'm ready" message
  - stop  BTdaemon after X minutes idle
- iPhone status icon support
  - bt_control_iphone.c -> bt_control_iphone.m
  - call SpringBoard on/off BT
  - create BTstack icon. Flipped B in red
=== BTdaemon can run always

  - incoming connections
    - list of supported PSM
	- commands and events
=== Incoming L2CAP supported
- client/server part using unix domain sockets (portable and fast)
- configuration: /etc/btstack
  - single Bluetooth module supported
  - transport type: H4, H5, USB
  - h4/h5: usart name
  - usb: product/vendor ID
  - logging mode: text, bluez, packetlogger
- implement rest of L2CAP state machine
  - error handling
  - error notification
  - flow control
  - reassembly/segmentation
- DEMOS:
  - BTstack-cmd

== Release Version 0.1
- implement RFCOMM
- implement SDP
- implement PAN

== Release Version 0.2
- naming conventions for various layers
  - if all control is done by pseudo hci commands, only bt_send_cmd(&cmd_name, ... ) is needed anyway
- auto-generate code for sending commands from structured text input file
- devise concept for access to event data
  - auto-generate event struct getter? STRUCTURE_get_FIELD
