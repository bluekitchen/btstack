/* new todo file for BTstack */

REFACTOR
- implement data_source
  - single fd per data_source
- implement run_loop
- adapt current BT implementation to use new run_loop

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
- implement single connection event-driven socket server
  - socket fd in data_source can be temp. replaced by actual connection fd

IMPROVE
- implement TimerSource
- implement some kind of noitfy mechanism between multiple units
- make SocketServer object-oriented
  - put data into struct
  - DataSource * dataSource = SocketServer_createUnixSocket( name );
  - DataSource * dataSource = SocketServer_createTcpSocket( port);
  - how to handle multiple parallel connections?
    - callback to announce new connection, allow to store local context pointer
