/* new todo file for BTstack */

UNTIL 13. August 2009 : Google Open Source Jam
- DEMOS:
  - OpenGL-ES-WiiMote
    - WiiMote - http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote#Bluetooth_Communication
    - turn on accellerometer by sending packet 52 12 00 33 over PSM 0x13 OR 0x11 - 0x13 did not work -> send to 0x11
    - quick hack: run BTstack run loop in separate thread and use performOnMainThread to deliver data
	- better: move run_loop.c to run_loop_posix.c and create run_loop_darwin.c
  - BTstack-cmd - running on laptop and iPhone? 
    - info
	- inquiry
	- remote name
	- open/close l2cap connection
    - evtl. SDP browser
  
NEXT:
- better connection management
  - connections are managed in BTdaemon
  - implement short cut for create connection, when connection already open
  - already track connection request for better parallel access
- naming conventions for various layers
  - if all control is done by pseudo hci commands, only bt_send_cmd(&cmd_name, ... ) is needed anyway
- auto-generate code for sending commands from structured text input file
- devise concept for access to event data
  - auto-generate event struct getter? STRUCTURE_get_FIELD
- implement rest of L2CAP state machine
  - incoming
  - error handling
  - error notification
  - reassembly is best done in BTdaemon, assigning source_cids too.
- client/server part using unix domain sockets (portable and fast)
- implement RFCOMM
- implement SDP
- implement PAN
