/* new todo file for BTstack */

UNTIL 13. August 2009 : Google Open Source Jam
- implement L2CAP state machine (outgoing only) - take care for matching channels with signaling packets better
  - test sig_id for incoming responses - 
  - test channel id for incoming requests (
- decide on naming conventions for various layers
- decide where L2CAP state machine belongs
- decide on l2CAP event/data interface
  - client only sends L2CAP packets (or higher) - no need to send/receive raw ACL packets
- provide demos:
  - BT Scanner: module info, inquiry, remote name
  - Terminal app with L2CAP support - Python or Java PC demo
	- implement l2cap_send_packet
    - readline? own command line support?
  - evtl. SDP browser
  - evtl. RFCOMM to BT GPS
  
NEXT:
- implement rest of L2CAP state machine
  - incoming
  - error handling
  - error notification
- client/server part using unix domain sockets (portable and fast)
- implement RFCOMM
- implement
- use linked_list for: 
  - event handler
  - data handler
- implement PAN
- implement some kind of noitfy mechanism between multiple units
