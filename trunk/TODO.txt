/* new todo file for BTstack */

2009-11-08: Release 0.1
2010-06-20: Release 0.2 - SDP + iOS 4 support
2010-11-2x: Release 0.2 - revsion 973 for WeBe++
- Fix for regression bug in 0.2-899 that prevented automatic disabling of Apple Bluetooth stack, less crashes
- Startup: send kill signal to BlueTool and BTServer, if necessary
- Connection setup: don't close baseband during authentication
- Remote Device DB: automatic link key handling in BTdaemon, provide cached remote names during inquiry
- SDP: use 1000 bytes MTU, fix partial responses, fix an incompatibility with Windows native statck
- Cocoa run_loop: added timeouts, include in libBTstack.dylib build
2010-xxxx: Release 0.2 - revions xxx
- limit size of /tmp/hci_dump.pklg to 1000 packets (max 1 MB)
- power handling: receive power notifications
   
NEXT:
- power handling
  - DONE: figure out how to receive iPhone System Power IONotifications (in BTdaemon) to detect, when phone gets locked and wakes up 
  - DONE: introduce HCI states SLEEPING and FALLING_ASLEEP
  - DONE: introduce HCI power mode command SLEEP
  - stop all baseband connections on HCI_POWER_OFF and HCI_POWER_SLEEP
  - for now, treat sleep/wake the same as power off/on
  - decide on configure flags
  - clean up components

- decide what to do with the CocoaTouch code.
  - do nothing
  - add it to libBTstack.dylib
  - provide a libBTstackCocoaTouch.dylib?  
  
- move RFCOMM code into BTdaemon
- have a look at External Accessory interface by Apple - it's quite similar in function to BTstack

- HCI CMD packet is limited to 1024 bytes payload. SDP records could be larger than that. Options:
  - provide a way to transfer SDP records in segments
  - ignore HCI command lenght on socket connection and directly stream data without buffer
- L2CAP 
  - segmentation
- Link Key storage in Bluetooth module
  - store link keys in Bluetooth module. requires algorithm to evict old one but unclear how to implement that
- extend SpringBoard feedback
  - show alerts/messages using SpringBoardAcccess, e.g. Bluetooth disconnected by remote device
  - add code to notify about remote disconnets
- configuration: /etc/btstack
  - single Bluetooth module supported
  - transport type: H4, H5, USB
  - h4/h5: UART path
  - usb: product/vendor ID
  - logging mode: text, bluez, packetlogger
- add configure option for uart flowcontrol
- create <btstack/errors.h>
- Bluetooth low-power modes useful

== USB Support ==
- Store array of data sources to be able to remove them on usb_close
- create little "reserve Bluetooth module on Mac OS X" tool

== Objective-C Interface ==
- have a look at External Accessory interface by Apple - it's quite similar
- move connection methods to BTdevice (get more object oriented)
  - initWithAddress:(bd_addr_t *)addr
  - setters private
- implement l2cap code
- implement rfcomm code
- animate discovery dialog:
  * use indexPathsForVisibleRows and cellForRowAtIndexPath: when you want to refresh just the cells that are on the screen
  * use insertRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: to add rows
  * use deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: to remove them-

== Refactor/Improve Architecture ==
- add linked_list_iterator that can remove elements (used by l2cap_close_connection and sdp_unregister_services_for_connection
- clean up control flow
  - l2cap directly sends data over socket: good/bad?
  - split daemon into stack parts
  - should there be STACK API/interface?
- unify packet generation
  - btstack events
  - cmd packets
  - l2cap commands
- auto-generate code for sending commands from structured text input file
- devise concept for access to event data
  - auto-generate event struct getter? STRUCTURE_get_FIELD
