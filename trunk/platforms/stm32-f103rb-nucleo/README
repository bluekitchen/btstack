BTstack port for STM32 F103RB Nucleo board and CC256x Bluetooth chipset
based on GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors and libopencm3

GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors: 
https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

libopencm3 is automatically build from its git repository

Configuration:
- LED on PA5
- Debug UART: USART2 - 9600/8/N/1, TX on PA2
- Bluetooth: USART3 with Hardware Flowcontrol. TX PB10, RX PB11, CTS PB13 (in), RTS PB14 (out), N_SHUTDOWN PB15

TODO:
- figure out how to compile multiple examples with single Makefile/folder
- implement hal_uart_dma.h
- implement hal_cpu.h
- create and implement hal_led.h
- extract classic and le examples into example/embedded
- use examples from BTSTACK_ROOT/example/embedded directly
