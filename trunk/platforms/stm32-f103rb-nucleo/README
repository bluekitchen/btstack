BTstack port for STM32 F103RB Nucleo board and CC256x Bluetooth chipset
based on GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors and libopencm3

GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors: 
https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

libopencm3 is automatically fetched and build from its git repository by make

openocd 0.8.0 (or higher) is used to upload firmware

Configuration:
- Sys tick 1 ms (can be much slower for BTstack)
- LED on PA5, on when MCU in Run mode and off while in Sleep mode
- Debug UART: USART2 - 9600/8/N/1, TX on PA2
- Bluetooth: USART3 with hardware flowcontrol RTS. IRQ on CTS Rising. TX PB10, RX PB11, CTS PB13 (in), RTS PB14 (out), N_SHUTDOWN PB15

TODO:
- figure out how to compile multiple examples with single Makefile/folder
- extract classic and le examples into example/embedded
- use examples from BTSTACK_ROOT/example/embedded directly
