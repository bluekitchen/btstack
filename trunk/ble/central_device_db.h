/** 

	A Central Device DB is only required for signed writes
	
	Per bonded device, it stores the Identity Resolving Key (IRK), the Connection Signature Resolving Key (CSRK)
	   and the last used counter

	The IRK is necessary to identify a device that uses private addresses
	The CSRK is used to generate the signatur on the remote device and is needed to verify the signature itself
	The Counter is necessary to prevent reply attacks
