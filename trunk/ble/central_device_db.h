	LE Device DB for pure LE Peripherals is only required for signed writes
	
	Per bonded device, it can store 
	- it stores the Identity Resolving Key (IRK) and its address to resolve private addresses
    - it stores the LTK + EDIV, RAND. EDIV + RAND allow a LE Perihperal to reconstruct the LTK
    - it stores the Connection Signature Resolving Key (CSRK) and the last used counter.
    	The CSRK is used to generate the signatur on the remote device and is needed to verify the signature itself
		The Counter is necessary to prevent reply attacks
