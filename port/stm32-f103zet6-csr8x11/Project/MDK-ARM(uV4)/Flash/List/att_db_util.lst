N    * Return value is the length of the string that _would_ have
N    * been written, i.e. the length of src plus the original length
N    * of dst. Thus, the operation succeeded without truncation if
N    * and only if ret < len; otherwise, the value in ret tells you
N    * how big to make dst if you decide to reallocate it. (That
N    * value does _not_ include the NUL.)
N    * 
N    * If no NUL is encountered within the first len bytes of dst,
N    * then the length of dst is considered to have been equal to
N    * len for the purposes of the return value (as if there were a
N    * NUL at dst[len]). Thus, the return value in this case is len
N    * + strlen(src).
N    * 
N    * This is a BSD-derived library extension, which we are
N    * permitted to declare in a standard header because ISO defines
N    * function names beginning with 'str' as reserved for future
N    * expansion of <string.h>.

N    /*
N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.

N * Multibyte Character Functions.
N * The behaviour of the multibyte character functions is affected by the
N * LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. For a state-dependent encoding,
N * each function is placed into its initial state by a call for which its
N * character pointer argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s
N * as other than a null pointer cause the internal state of the function to be
N * altered as necessary. A call with s as a null pointer causes these functions
N * to return a nonzero value if encodings have state dependency, and a zero
N * otherwise. After the LC_CTYPE category is changed, the shift state of these
N * functions is indeterminate.

N    * The va_arg macro expands to an expression that has the type and value of
N    * the next argument in the call. The parameter ap shall be the same as the
N    * va_list ap initialised by va_start. Each invocation of va_arg modifies
N    * ap so that successive arguments are returned in turn. The parameter
N    * 'type' is a type name such that the type of a pointer to an object that
N    * has the specified type can be obtained simply by postfixing a * to
N    * 'type'. If type is a narrow type, an error is given in strict ANSI
N    * mode, or a warning otherwise. If the type is an array or function type,
N    * an error is given.
N    * In non-strict ANSI mode, 'type' is allowed to be any expression.
N    * Returns: The first invocation of the va_arg macro after that of the
N    *          va_start macro returns the value of the argument after that
N    *          specified by parmN. Successive invocations return the values of
N    *          the remaining arguments in succession.
N    *          The result is cast to 'type', even if 'type' is narrow.
