/*
Changes from V3.2.1
	+ CallReturn Depth increased from 8 to 10 levels to accomodate wizC/fedC V12.
	
Changes from V3.2.0
	+ TBLPTRU is now initialised to zero during the initial stack creation of a new task. This solves
	an error on devices with more than 64kB ROM.

Changes from V3.0.0
	+ ucCriticalNesting is now initialised to 0x7F to prevent interrupts from being
          handled before the scheduler is started.

Changes from V3.0.1
