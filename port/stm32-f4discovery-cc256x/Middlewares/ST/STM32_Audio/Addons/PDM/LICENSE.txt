NO WARRANTY

The Licensed Software is provided “as is” and “with all faults” without warranty

warranties, expressed, implied or otherwise, including without limitation,
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and

You are responsible for determining whether the Licensed Software will be
suitable for your intended use or application or will achieve your intended
results. ST will not be liable to You and/or to any third party for the
derivative works of the Licensed Software developed by You.

ST has not authorised anyone to make any representation or warranty for the

assume for it any other liability in connection with the Licensed Software.

Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as:

(i) a warranty or representation by ST to maintain production of any ST device
or other hardware or software with which the Licensed Software may be used or to
otherwise maintain or support the Licensed Software in any manner; or

(ii) a commitment from ST and/or its licensors to bring or prosecute actions or
suits against third parties for infringement of any of the rights licensed
hereby, or conferring any rights to bring or prosecute actions or suits against
third parties for infringement. However, ST has the right to terminate this
Agreement immediately upon receiving notice of any claim, suit or proceeding
that alleges that the Licensed Software or Your use or distribution of the
Licensed Software infringes any third party intellectual property rights.

All other warranties, conditions or other terms implied by law are excluded to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES

any indirect, special, consequential, incidental, punitive damages or other
damages (including but not limited to, the cost of labor, re-qualification,
delay, loss of profits, loss of revenues, loss of data, costs of procurement of
substitute goods or services or the like) whether based on contract, tort, or
any other legal theory, relating to or in connection with the Licensed Software,
the documentation or this Agreement, even if ST has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

In no event shall ST’s liability to You or any third party under this Agreement,
including any claim with respect of any third party intellectual property
rights, for any cause of action exceed 100 US$. This section does not apply to
the extent prohibited by law. For the purposes of this section, any liability of
ST shall be treated in the aggregate.

TERMINATION

ST may terminate this Agreement, including its licenses, at any time if You are
in material breach of any of its terms and conditions and You have failed to
cure such breach within 30 (thirty) days after receiving notification from ST of
such breach. Upon termination, You will immediately destroy or return all copies
of the Licensed Software (including without limitation any documentation) to ST.
After termination, Your sole surviving right will be to continue to use the
Licensed Software solely to the extent that it was already incorporated before
Your material breach of this Agreement into Your Products, which were sold by
You before the date of Your material breach.

APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Agreement and matters connected with the validity, interpretation or
performance thereof shall be governed, construed, interpreted, and applied in
all respects by the law in place in Switzerland, without resort to conflict of
laws principles. The Parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this
Agreement or to their relationship.

Dispute Resolution. The Parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction in the court
of Canton of Geneva, Switzerland for purposes of any litigation arising from
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section shall
prevent either Party seeking interim injunctive relief from a court or tribunal
of appropriate jurisdiction.

SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this agreement is or becomes, at any time or for any reason,
unenforceable or invalid, no other provision of this agreement shall be affected
thereby, and the remaining provisions of this agreement shall continue with the
same force and effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions had not
been inserted in this Agreement.

WAIVER

The failure or delay of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent
breach of the same or a different provision.

ASSIGNMENT

This Agreement may not be assigned by You, nor any of Your rights or obligations
hereunder, to any third party without prior written consent of ST. In the event
that this Agreement is assigned effectively to a third party, this Agreement
shall bind upon successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES

Nothing in this Agreement shall create, or be deemed to create, a partnership or
the relationship of principal and agent or employer and employee between the
Parties. Neither Party has the authority or power to bind, to contract in the
name of or to create a liability for the other in any way or for any purpose.
