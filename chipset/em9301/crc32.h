/*
 *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
 *  polynomial is
 *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
 *
 *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
 *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
 *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
 *  the MSB being 1
 *
 *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which
 *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit
 *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our
 *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we
 *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in
 *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit
 *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way
 *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART
 *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit
 *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit
 *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly
 *
 *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes
 *
 *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so
 *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback
 *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera
 *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values
 *
 *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc
 *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some
 *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by
 *      using byte-swap instructions
 *      polynomial $edb88320
